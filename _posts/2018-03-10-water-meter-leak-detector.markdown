Do you suspect that you have a leak on your water system? Or are you just curious to do a test?  If so, the first thing to do is to take a peek at your water meter!


## Where Is My Water Meter?
The water meter is located somewhere near the front of your property or on the sidewalk. It will be housed in a rectangular box with a metal lid. Some are above ground, most are in the ground and the lid is at the same level as the dirt around it.
The lid will have a imprinted mark of the Board of Water on it as the meter belongs to them.

### NOTE
**Do not tamper with the meter at all as it too is property of the Board of Water.**


## Plumbing Leak Test - True or False
You may, however, lift the lid to see if the small, red triangle is moving. If so, and no one is using any water in your home or on the property, you may have a leak. Note that if you have an ice maker line on your refrigerator, and it is filling, the meter will move. You must be sure that no fixtures or appliances that require water, are in use. Some of the most common leaks are caused by the following:

* Running Toilets
* Leaking Sprinkler Valve
* Dripping Faucet
* Shower Valve

Take a look at the image here of a water meter. Notice the small red triangle on the left side? If that triangle is moving when the water is turned off to your home then you have a leak somewhere on your property. If the triangle is not moving then you have nothing to worry about.
