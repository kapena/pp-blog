When running a copper or PVC waterline across the path of an active driveway that consists of vehicular traffic and gates that open and close, it would be advisable to protect the water pipe underneath from damage by heavy weight.

### How to protect your water pipeline form damage.  

One way to achieve this would be to run the smaller water pipe inside a pipe with larger diameter. I would recommend using gray Schedule 80 with thick walls as the protective encasement for the water pipe.

The two images are an illustration of this information. Once the copper pipe is out of the danger zone, it can be run without the protective encasement the remainder of the way.

(Before covering with dirt) This safe design will reduce driveway and gate stress on the copper underneath.
