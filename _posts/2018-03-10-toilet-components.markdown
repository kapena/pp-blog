There are only 3 main components in a standard toilet tank.  You should know their names to identify malfunction when the toilet presents problems.  You can recognize tank troubles by noticing the following symptoms:  

* Constant or intermittent sound of running water into the bowl.
* Hissing Noise.
* Flush won’t engage at all or will engage but poor flush.  

## The Three Main Toilet Components

#### 1. Tank Handle   
This is the lever that raises the flapper or canister on the flush valve to allow water out of the tank, into the bowl.  If the arm that attaches to the outer handle is broken, you will get no response or a very poor response when you try to flush.
#### 2. Fill Valve
This component allows water into the tank and shuts the water off when it reaches the tank water fill line.  There is a problem if you recognize that after flushing, you can hear that the toilet doesn’t shut off completely.  Alternatively it could make a squealing sound.  This is calling for repair or replacement of the fill valve.
#### 3. Flush Valve  
This part is located in the center of the tank and holds the water in the tank.  The flapper is connected to the flush valve via a chain which activates the flapper or canister by letting water into the bowl, allowing the flushing action. If the toilet is running the flapper has deteriorated and may need to be replaced.  On a canister flush valve there is no flapper, just a seal at the base which will need to be removed for new one to be installed.
